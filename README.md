# Console Chess Game in C++
Welcome to the Console Chess Game, a C++ implementation of chess divided into three exciting parts. This game offers a comprehensive chess experience with unique gameplay modes to challenge your strategic thinking.

### Position-Based Gameplay
The game operates based on the positions given by the user. Players will input the initial positions of the pieces for each part, allowing for customized and dynamic gameplay.

## Game Features
### Part 1: Classic 2-Player Chess
Engage in a traditional 2-player chess game. Each player takes turns moving their pieces, aiming to checkmate the opponent's king. Enjoy the timeless strategy and depth of classic chess.

### Part 2: Scenario-Based Challenges
Test your skills in a scenario-based game where you can choose one of the following setups:

- 2 Bishops
- 2 Knights
- 2 Rooks
- 1 Queen

In this mode:
- Player 1 must protect their king.
- Player 2 uses their chosen pieces to try and checkmate Player 1's king.


### Part 3: Checkmate Puzzle
Solve intricate checkmate puzzles. One king is surrounded by other pieces, and through strategic movements, achieve checkmate. This part enhances your problem-solving skills and deepens your understanding of endgame strategies.
